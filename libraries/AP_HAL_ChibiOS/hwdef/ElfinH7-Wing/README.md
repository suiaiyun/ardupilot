## UART Mapping

The UARTs are marked Rn and Tn in the above pinouts. The Rn pin is the
receive pin for UARTn. The Tn pin is the transmit pin for UARTn.

 - SERIAL0 -> USB
 - SERIAL1 -> UART1 (Telem1)
 - SERIAL2 -> UART2 (Telem2)
 - SERIAL3 -> UART3 (GPS)
 - SERIAL4 -> UART4 (GPS)
 - SERIAL5 -> None
 - SERIAL6 -> UART6 (RCIN one wire, DMA-enabled)
 - SERIAL7 -> UART7
 - SERIAL8 -> UART8

## RC Input

RC input is configured on the R6 (UART6_RX) pin. It supports all serial RC protocols. For protocols requiring half-duplex serial to transmit telemetry (such as FPort) you should setup SERIAL5 as an RC input serial port,
with half-duplex, pin-swap and inversion enabled.

## OSD Support

The ElfinH7-Wing supports OSD using OSD_TYPE 1 (MAX7456 driver).

## PWM Output

The ElfinH7-Wing supports up to 13 PWM outputs. The pads for motor output M1 to M12 on the motor connectors , plus M13 for LED strip or another PWM output. 

The PWM is in 5 groups:

 - PWM 1-4         in group1
 - PWM 5-8         in group2
 - PWM 9,10       in group3
 - PWM 11,12     in group4
 - PWM 13          in group5 (used for NeoPixel LED)

Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate. If any channel in a group uses DShot then all channels in the group need to use DShot. Channels 1-4 support bi-directional dshot.

## Battery Monitoring

The board has a builting voltage sensor and external current sensor input. . The voltage sensor can handle up to 6S LiPo batteries.

The correct battery setting parameters are:

 - BATT_MONITOR 4
 - BATT_VOLT_PIN 10
 - BATT_CURR_PIN 11
 - BATT_VOLT_MULT 11.1
 - BATT_AMP_PERVLT 59.5

## Compass

The ElfinH7-Wing does not have a builtin compass, but you can attach an external compass using I2C on the SDA and SCL pads.

## Loading Firmware

Firmware for these boards can be found at https://firmware.ardupilot.org in sub-folders labeled “ElfinH7-Wing”.   

This is different from common FC. Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the "AP_Bootloader.bin" firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using any ArduPilot ground station software. Updates should be done with the *.apj firmware files.
